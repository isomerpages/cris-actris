<p>Our cGMP-certified laboratories provide the necessary space and resources for conducting critical pre-manufacturing process development activities. This enables us to identify the most optimal standard operating protocols to perform resource, time and cost-efficient manufacturing of cell, tissue, and gene therapy products. </p> 

<p> Our team of experienced scientists will assist you in scaling up various cell types, progressing from small-scale culture wells and flasks to cell culture bags, cell factories, and automated cell culture systems. </p>
