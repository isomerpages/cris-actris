Our cGMP-certified laboratories provide the necessary space and resources for conducting critical pre-manufacturing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; process development activities. This enables us to identify the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most optimal standard operating protocols to perform &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resource, time and cost-efficient manufacturing of cell, tissue, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and gene therapy products. Our team of experience scientist &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will assist you in scaling up various cell types, progressing from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; small-scale culture wells and flasks to cell culture bags, cell factories, and automated cell culture systems.
