<p>On 23 August 2023, the Minister for Health officially launched the ACTRIS
facility — Singapore’s largest national manufacturing facility for CGT
— affirming its role as a cornerstone of the nation’s growing CGT ecosystem.</p>
<p>ACTRIS began onboarding early collaborative projects to support the manufacture
of investigational CGT products that reached the first few patients in
Singapore.</p>
<p>Guided by the National Medical Research Council Office (NMRCO) and MOH,
ACTRIS secured RIE2025 funding to advance research translation, enhance
process development capabilities with A*STAR Bioprocessing Technology Institute
(BTI), and expand manufacturing of investigational CGT products.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Despite the global disruption of COVID-19, ACTRIS pressed on — designing
and constructing a state-of-the-art facility, installing specialised equipment,
and strengthening awareness of its role within Singapore’s CGT ecosystem.</p>
<p>Guided by MOH, ACTRIS secured baseline operational funding to recruit
and train critical expertise and commission the facility essential for
national readiness.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>As plans matured, the focus turned to capability building. Guided by MOH,
the NCTC IO secured government funding for infrastructure — paving the
way for a national facility to accelerate CGT development and access.</p>
<p>Building on this foundation, NCTC evolved into ACTRIS — the Advanced Cell
Therapy and Research Institute, Singapore — and on 20 April 2020, became
part of the Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation, Singapore
(CRIS).</p>

<p>To translate this vision into action, the NCTC Implementation Office (IO)
was established to define strategy, governance, and resource requirements.
The IO laid a strong foundation to enable research translation and enhance
clinical access to CGTs.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>It began with a vision — to make cell and gene therapy (CGT) a reality
for patients in Singapore and beyond. Guided by the Ministry of Health’s
(MOH) National Cell Therapy Services Advisory Committee, the concept of
a National Cell Therapy Centre (NCTC) took shape through extensive horizon
scanning, global benchmarking, and strategic engagement with hospitals,
research institutes, and industry partners.</p>
