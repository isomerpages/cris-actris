<h2>We Are ACTRIS</h2>
<p>ACTRIS was established in April 2020 to meet the increasing clinical demand
for cellular therapeutics to treat various life-threatening diseases.</p>
<p>Our vision is to be the national and regional Centre of Excellence for
facilitating discovery, process development, and manufacturing of cellular-based
therapeutics across the broad spectrum of immunotherapy and regenerative
medicine, encompassing both investigational and clinical-use products for
Singapore.</p>
<p>Through its specialised infrastructure and skilled workforce, ACTRIS aims
to promote and support the entire value chain of the cell therapy ecosystem
by enabling translational research and development, manufacturing, clinical
service provision, and commercialisation across the healthcare, academic
and industrial sectors.</p>
<p>In addition, ACTRIS will also provide value-added services such as workforce
training, regulatory support, and the standardisation of ancillary materials
and product testing pertaining to the delivery of cellular therapy to patients.</p>
<p>ACTRIS is a programme of CRIS.</p>
