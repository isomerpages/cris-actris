<p>We are honoured to have hosted Swedish delegates during their state visit
to Singapore last week, which celebrated over 50 years of bilateral ties
between the two countries and set the stage for stronger collaboration.
<br>
<br>Our staff introduced ACTRIS's role as a national facility for clinical-scale
manufacturing of cell therapy products in meeting the demand for both clinical
trials and essential clinical services, as well as to spearhead the growth
of Singapore's cell and gene therapy (CGT) ecosystem through workforce
training and regulatory facilitation. We also shared about the role of
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/crissg/" class="wVkswPqfFJemBuesOohtSFOOfIrNteBxRA" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation, Singapore (CRIS)</a>in
supporting ACTRIS and five other programmes in developing strategies to
facilitate synergistic collaborations to advance clinical research here
and beyond.
<br>
<br>Delegates toured our translational laboratories and engaged in insightful
conversations discussing the CGT manufacturing landscape in Singapore and
Sweden.
<br>
<br>We enjoyed the knowledge exchange and shared about similarities in regulatory
alignment, operational strategies, and collaborative approaches to meet
current needs. It was a wonderful way to wrap up a fulfilling week.</p>
