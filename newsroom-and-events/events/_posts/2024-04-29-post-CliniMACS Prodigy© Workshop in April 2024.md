<p>Last week, our CliniMACS Prodigy© workshop brought together a diverse
group of researchers, biotech manufacturing experts and graduate students
specialising in cell therapy research, stem cell biology and GMP cell manufacturing
for an insightful exchange.
<br>
<br>Jointly organised with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/miltenyi-biotec/" class="wVkswPqfFJemBuesOohtSFOOfIrNteBxRA" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Miltenyi Biotec</a>,
the workshop offered participants hands-on learning and a deep dive into
the Adherent Cell Culture (ACC) process to learn how such systems enable
the culture and expansion of stem cells in a GMP-compliant setting.
<br>
<br>Likening the programming of manufacturing processes to the assembly of
Lego blocks, Dr Kelly Wee, PhD and Dr Shu Cheng W., Technical and Application,
Miltenyi Biotec, shed light on the benefits of consistent and scalable
GMP-compliant manufacturing. It was an insightful afternoon where participants
explored the system and customised sample modular applications.
<br>
<br>Through these training initiatives, ACTRIS aims to equip the local cell
therapy manufacturing workforce with the skills and knowledge required
to effectively utilise new technologies, paving the way for greater innovation
applications in targeted therapeutic interventions and improving patient
outcomes. We hope to cultivate a community of knowledge experts in cell
and gene therapy.</p>
