<p>We had the pleasure of hosting Mr Teo Chee Hean, Senior Minister and Coordinating
Minister for National Security and Special Advisor to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nrfsg/" class="wVkswPqfFJemBuesOohtSFOOfIrNteBxRA" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">National Research Foundation Singapore</a>,
at our cell therapy facility last week.
<br>
<br>Adj A/Prof <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danny-soon-97434a9/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Danny Soon</a>,
CRIS CEO and ACTRIS Interim Executive Director, provided an overview of
ACTRIS’ integral role in supporting clinical trials and clinical services
for cell and gene therapies by providing manufacturing and process development
services for our healthcare, research and biotech ecosystem.
<br>
<br>Dr <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-choo-8901ba40/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Andre Choo</a>,
Deputy Executive Director, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a-star-bti/" class="wVkswPqfFJemBuesOohtSFOOfIrNteBxRA" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">A*STAR Bioprocessing Technology Institute (BTI)</a>,
and colleagues then provided an update on Singapore’s recent developments
in R&amp;D and biotech initiatives for CGT. By harnessing innovative manufacturing
technologies and establishing strategic partnerships we are advancing forward
in translating cutting-edge research into effective CGTs for better patient
outcomes.
<br>
<br>Following this, SM Teo engaged in a meaningful discussion with the team
on how Singapore can facilitate more public-private partnerships with companies
looking to develop their CGT products in Singapore. The conversation also
touched on strategies for enhancing capabilities to meet the growing demand
for cell therapy development and manufacturing for cancer treatments and
regenerative medicine, so that Singapore can continue to be relevant in
this fast-evolving biomedical field.
<br>
<br>To culminate the visit, SM Teo toured the translational laboratories for
a deeper understanding of the manufacturing process of at the facility
for patients’ access in our local hospitals.
<br>
<br>It was an insightful afternoon of knowledge exchange with strategic partners.
We are excited about the possibilities that lie ahead as we continue to
explore synergies and push the boundaries of cell therapy together.</p>
