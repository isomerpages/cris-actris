𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺, and had the opportunity to deepen their understanding through
a combination of theory and hands-on practical demonstrations.

<br>From 𝗰𝗲𝗹𝗹 𝗲𝗻𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗵𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻,
𝘀𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝘃𝗲𝘀𝘁, participants explored the 𝗲𝗻𝗱-𝘁𝗼-𝗲𝗻𝗱
𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄 and discussed how automation can drive efficiency and
consistency in cell therapy production. It was an engaging session with
many thoughtful questions raised — and we’re glad the trainers were able
to address them comprehensively.
<br>

sharing their expertise and guiding participants through the full CAR-T
manufacturing process.
