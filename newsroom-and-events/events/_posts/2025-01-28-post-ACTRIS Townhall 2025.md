<p>ACTRIS leadership and staff held an advance lunar new year celebration
at our town hall last week! We re-capped our achievements and shared our
plans for collaboration and partnerships as we look forward to strengthening
our bonds as a community.</p>
<p>Key highlights include:</p>
<p>Engaging and heartfelt sharing by ACTRIS leadership on our goals and aspirations
for the year ahead. We look forward to building up capabilities for ACTRIS
to serve as a national facility for clinical-scale manufacturing of cell
therapy products and thriving opportunities to spearhead the growth advancements
in cell and gene therapy (CGT) in Singapore.</p>
<p>ACTRIS is also ramping up to bring value to CGT ecosystem needs through
workforce training and regulatory facilitation, as well as paving pathways
for CGT into clinical settings by ecosystem partners.</p>
<p>The town hall concluded on a high note with a bountiful Lo Hei toss to
signify abundance.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s to another fruitful year of drawing on our collective strength
to power through and achieve impactful progress and growth! Check out the
