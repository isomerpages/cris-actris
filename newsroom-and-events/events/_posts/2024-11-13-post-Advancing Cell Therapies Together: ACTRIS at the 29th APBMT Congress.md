<p>We had the privilege of participating in the 29th Annual Congress of the
Asia-Pacific Bone Marrow Transplantation Group, where the theme,&nbsp;Harnessing
the Immune System, fostered valuable discussions on cutting-edge treatments
and innovations shaping the future of patient care.
<br>
<br>At our booth, we were delighted to share how ACTRIS was established as
a national facility to centralise resources, manpower, and capabilities
across Singapore to enhance operational efficiencies. This approach also
aims to scale up the manufacturing of cell and gene therapy products, potentially
moderating the cost of these treatments and expanding patient access in
time to come.
<br>
<br>The congress offered an invaluable opportunity to engage with like-minded
professionals and thought leaders in the CGT space, all united by a shared
commitment to advancing breakthrough therapies and improving patient outcomes.
<br>
<br>A heartfelt thank you to everyone who visited our booth to learn more
about ACTRIS and our initiatives in the clinical translation of advanced
cell therapies. Together, we are shaping the future of healthcare and making
meaningful strides toward better patient outcomes!</p>
