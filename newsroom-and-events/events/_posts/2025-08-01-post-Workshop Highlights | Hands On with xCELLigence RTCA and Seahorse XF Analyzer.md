<p>Last week, we wrapped up our joint-lab workshop in collaboration with <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/agilent-technologies/" class="caiWCvyDugkegDgxnadiJHvVQjzWiGLzAs" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Agilent Technologies</a></strong> –
“Optimizing Cell Therapy Workflows: Hands-On with xCELLigence RTCA and
Seahorse Technology."
<br>
<br>The full-day session brought participants through both lecture and hands-on
sessions, equipping them with practical knowledge on Agilent’s powerful
platforms for real-time cell analysis.
<br>
<br>The morning featured lectures on Agilent's xCELLigence RTCA and Seahorse
XF Analyzer, followed by practical sessions in the afternoon. Participants
worked through workflows including background reading, cell seeding, initiating
experiments, and software analysis for cell proliferation and potency using
the xCELLigence RTCA system.
<br>
<br>They also explored Seahorse XF Analyzer procedures— learning to evaluate
mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis through real-time OCR, PER, and
ECAR measurements. Participants were guided through essential steps such
as cartridge hydration, cell seeding, drug ports loading, and software
analysis.
<br>
<br>The workshop concluded with a short quiz to reinforce participants’ knowledge
and understanding of the day’s content.
<br>
<br>A big thank you to the trainers <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chin-chieh-jj-loh-503a3a8/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Chin-Chieh (JJ) Loh</a></strong> and
Dr <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/federicatomay/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Federica Tomay, PhD, MSc</a></strong> from
Agilent Technologies for guiding the sessions and sharing your invaluable
expertise. And to all our participants – thank you for your enthusiasm!
We hope you enjoyed the experience and left with fresh expertise to apply
in your cell therapy product characterisation workflow.</p>
