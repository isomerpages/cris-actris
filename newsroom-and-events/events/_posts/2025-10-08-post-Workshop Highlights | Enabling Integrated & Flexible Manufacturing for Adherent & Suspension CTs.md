<p>We had an exciting and enriching day at the September run of the 𝗔𝗖𝗧𝗥𝗜𝗦
𝗦𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗽 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱, held in collaboration
with <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/terumo-bct/" class="SJEYEKQzirtEAeMdweWaSusuMVTjJkHSVBDAA" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Terumo Blood and Cell Technologies</a></strong>.
The morning sessions delved into the theory behind the Spectra Optia Apheresis
System (for cell collection) and the Quantum Flex Cell Expansion System
(for product manufacturing), providing participants with a solid foundation
for the hands-on activities that followed.
<br>
<br>In the afternoon, participants gained practical experience with the Quantum
Flex Cell Expansion System and the Finia Fill and Finish System (for product
formulation), discovering firsthand how automation can streamline workflows
from start to finish. The day wrapped up on a high note with a fun and
interactive quiz, giving everyone the opportunity to apply their new knowledge.
<br>
