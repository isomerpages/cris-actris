<p>Last week, ACTRIS partnered with <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/miltenyi-biotec/" class="SJEYEKQzirtEAeMdweWaSusuMVTjJkHSVBDAA" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Miltenyi Biotec</a></strong> as
part of the 𝗔𝗖𝗧𝗥𝗜𝗦 𝗦𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗽 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀
𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱 to host a full-day joint lab workshop. The session brought together
researchers, scientists, and professionals working in cell and gene therapy
to explore advances in CAR T cell manufacturing and analytics.
<br>
<br>Participants had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with the
CliniMACS Prodigy® and MACSQuant® Analyzer 10, learn how automation and
closed-system processing streamline CAR T workflows, and engage with expert
trainers and technical specialists in an interactive setting.
<br>
<br>Many attendees shared that the trainers were engaging and insightful,
making complex concepts practical and applicable to their work. We extend
our thanks to trainers <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelly-wee-phd/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Kelly Wee, PhD</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wongshucheng/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Shu Cheng W.</a></strong> for
leading the session with clarity and energy. Special appreciation also
goes to <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/advont-chua/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Jia Wang Chua, PhD</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yilong-lian-13414625a/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Yilong Lian</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julliekoh/" class="ember-view" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Jullie Koh</a></strong> for
their invaluable support in ensuring a smooth event.
<br>
<br>Beyond technical knowledge, the workshop fostered meaningful connections
within the cell therapy community, representing an important step in advancing
the field together.
