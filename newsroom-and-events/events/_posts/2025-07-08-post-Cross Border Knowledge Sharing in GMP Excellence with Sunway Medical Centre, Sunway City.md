<p>Back on 20 June 2025, ACTRIS had the privilege of hosting a distinguished
team from <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sunway-medical/" class="caiWCvyDugkegDgxnadiJHvVQjzWiGLzAs" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Sunway Medical Centre</a></strong>,
Sunway City (SMC), Malaysia.
<br>
<br>As SMC prepares to establish capabilities for cell and gene therapy manufacturing,
their visit focused on gaining firsthand insight into our GMP-certified
operations—from facility infrastructure to our quality management systems
and clinical lab workflows.
<br>
<br>The session included a meaningful exchange of perspectives, where SMC
shared their aspirations and institutional strengths, while ACTRIS showcased
our end-to-end capabilities in cell therapy development and manufacturing.
<br>
<br>We’re encouraged by SMC’s vision and commitment to advancing access to
advanced therapies to patients in Malaysia. At ACTRIS, we remain dedicated
to fostering collaborations that will continue the maturation of the local
and regional biomedical ecosystem ensuring healthcare and economic value
capture.
<br>
<br>Looking forward to continued knowledge-sharing and partnership opportunities!</p>
