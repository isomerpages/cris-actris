<p>We recently concluded the hands-on workshop on Sefia™ Cell Therapy Manufacturing
Platform: Streamlining End-to-End CAR T Manufacturing — it was incredible
to see the engagement and curiosity from all participants across various
expertise and backgrounds.
<br>
<br>Hosted in collaboration with <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/cytiva/" class="caiWCvyDugkegDgxnadiJHvVQjzWiGLzAs" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Cytiva</a></strong>,
the session offered an insight on how integrated, automated systems shape
the future of CAR T manufacturing.
<br>
<br>Through live demonstrations, participants observed the operational workflow
of the Sefia™ platform in action—from cell isolation, harvest, and formulation
using the Sefia Select™ system, to activation, transduction, and expansion
via the Sefia™ expansion system. They also explored how Chronicle™ software
ties everything together by digitally integrating both systems to streamline
batch record generation and improve traceability.
<br>
<br>Beyond the technical demonstrations, the workshop sparked thoughtful discussions
around process design, automation strategies to reduce batch failure risk,
and ways to enhance consistency and scalability in manufacturing.
<br>
<br>A big thank-you to everyone who joined us. We are proud to support Singapore’s
growing cell therapy community through shared learning and innovation.</p>
