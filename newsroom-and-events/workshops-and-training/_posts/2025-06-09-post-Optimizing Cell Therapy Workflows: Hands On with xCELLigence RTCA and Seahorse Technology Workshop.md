<p>How can cell and gene therapy (CGT) workflows be made faster, more efficient,
and insight-driven?
<br>
<br>As part of our 𝗼𝗻𝗴𝗼𝗶𝗻𝗴 🧬𝗔𝗖𝗧𝗥𝗜𝗦 𝗦𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀𝗵𝗼𝗽
𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱🧬, we’re excited to bring you our second session,
in collaboration with <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/agilent-technologies/" class="gQkgwqySbZfpxGEstmdeOKEBqibkNWt" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Agilent Technologies</a></strong>.
This hands-on workshop will focus on optimising cell therapy workflows
using cutting-edge analytical platforms.
<br>
<br>Discover how Agilent’s platforms are transforming cell and gene therapy
research:
<br>• The 𝘅𝗖𝗘𝗟𝗟𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗥𝗧𝗖𝗔 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 enables real-time monitoring
of effector-target cell interactions—critical for developing cytotoxicity
and potency assays.
<br>• The 𝗦𝗲𝗮𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝗫𝗙 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘇𝗲𝗿&nbsp;assesses cell function
and metabolic fitness by measuring mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis
in real time.
