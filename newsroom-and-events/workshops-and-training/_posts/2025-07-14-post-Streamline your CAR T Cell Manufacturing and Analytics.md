<p>As part of the <strong>ACTRIS Signature Workshop Series 2025</strong>,
we are pleased to launch a full-day workshop with Miltenyi Biotec, focused
on the next generation of CAR T cell manufacturing technologies. This event
is made possible through the joint laboratory that ACTRIS and Miltenyi
Biotec have established recently.
<br>
<br>Taking place on 𝗙𝗿𝗶𝗱𝗮𝘆, 𝟮𝟵 𝗔𝘂𝗴𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱, this workshop
offers hands-on experience with Miltenyi’s integrated platforms—the CliniMACS
Prodigy® for automated, closed-system manufacturing and the MACSQuant®
Analyzer 10 for high-throughput, multiparametric analysis. Together, these
systems enable greater efficiency, scalability, and regulatory alignment
in advanced cell therapy workflows.</p>
