Recent research on the successful translation of stem cell therapies to patients have enriched the hope that such regenerative strategies may one day become a treatment for a wide range of vexing diseases.&nbsp; In fact, an exponential advancement in clinical trials revolving around stem cell-based therapies have been observed over the past few years. To date, the most established stem cell treatment is haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for haematological and immune system disorders.

In this webinar, Dr Francesca Lorraine Lim will give a brief overview of the types of stem cell-based therapies, with a focus on the use of HSCT to treat blood cancers.
