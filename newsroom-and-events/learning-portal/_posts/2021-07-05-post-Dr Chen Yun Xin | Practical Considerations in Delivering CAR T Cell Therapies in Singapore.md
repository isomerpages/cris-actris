Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is changing the treatment landscape of haematological malignancies. As these treatments gain regulatory approvals and become an available option to patients meeting disease indications, administrative and logistical challenges in delivering CAR therapy outside of clinical trials have also emerged.

&nbsp;The success of CAR T-cell therapy has brought about much media attention and has led to tremendous excitement. Patients may also assume there will be broad access to cellular therapeutics in a similar fashion as other chemotherapeutic agents. However, there are challenges to make these truly available to them. The process of building cell therapy infrastructure, meeting regulatory requirements, and treating patients with CAR T-cell therapy require significant planning and coordination.
