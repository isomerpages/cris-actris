CAR-T therapy has changed the paradigm for the treatment of relapsed/refractory paediatric cancers who have otherwise exhausted all treatment options. However, the rapid translational success of cell therapy in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and lymphomas is not met with the same speed of translation in other paediatric childhood cancers. This talk will present an overview of the current success and challenges of CAR-T treatment in paediatric cancers including and beyond B-ALL, and where the unmet needs are for potential translational efforts.
