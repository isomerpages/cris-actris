Joint preservation is an area of intense research within the orthopaedic community. Osteoarthritis is a very common, progressive, and debilitating joint disease characterised by the degeneration of the osteochondral construct due to the inevitable processes of overuse (‘wear-and-tear’).

Arthroplasty is an option only for certain joints in the event of severe osteoarthritis, with robust evidence to date. The younger patient may be better suited to delaying joint replacement surgeries to negate the possibility of multiple joint revision surgeries in their lifetime.
