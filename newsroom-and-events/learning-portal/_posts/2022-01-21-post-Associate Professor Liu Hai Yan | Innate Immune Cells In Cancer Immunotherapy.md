Innate immune cells, such as innate lymphoid cells and γδ T-cells, are critical in establishing the tumour microenvironment, as well as initiating and regulating anti-tumour adaptive immune responses. Its direct cytotoxicity against tumour cells, which is independent of MHC presentation and regulatory functions, can be harnessed to combat cancer in the form of adoptive therapy.

This talk will discuss the clinical development in NK and γδ T-cell immunotherapy and pre-clinical efforts to enhance their therapeutic efficacies.

Assoc. Prof. Liu will also introduce a new professional certification programme on the Application of Immune Effector Cells in Cell Therapy by ACTRIS and NUS which trains and educate the workforce in the fast-growing field of cell therapy.
