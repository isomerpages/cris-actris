Cell therapy holds enormous promise for the treatment of diseases.&nbsp;

While the potential of cell therapy has been known for a while, the field has only started to expand in recent years.&nbsp;The use of CAR T-cell therapies to treat blood cancers in 2017 was a critical milestone in the field of cell therapy. Global investment in cell therapy amounted to USD$7.2 billion in 2020.&nbsp;

Learn more about the advancements and challenges in the field of #celltherapy at the inaugural Cell Therapy Lecture Series organised by the Advanced Cell Therapy and Research Institute, Singapore (ACTRIS).
