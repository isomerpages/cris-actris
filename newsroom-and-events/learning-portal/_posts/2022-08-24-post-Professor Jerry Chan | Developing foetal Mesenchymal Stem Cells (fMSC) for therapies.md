Primitive foetal mesenchymal stem cells (fMSC) hold unique characteristics that differ from their adult counterparts.

&nbsp;They have a higher capacity to expand without senescence, and do not form tumours in xenograft models. In addition, they have an expanded repertoire for directed differentiation.

&nbsp;This lecture will delve into the translation journey of developing fMSC for pre- and post-natal clinical applications.
