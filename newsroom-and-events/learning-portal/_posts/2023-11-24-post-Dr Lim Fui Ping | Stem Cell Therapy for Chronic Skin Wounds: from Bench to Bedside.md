Chronic wounds persist as a significant health care problem, particularly with increasing number of patients and the lack of efficient treatments. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have been explored in many studies to determine the healing ability for chronic wounds. 

This lecture aims to present the preclinical understanding of the mechanisms and effects of MSCs as well as current clinical trials which showcase their therapeutic potential. 

Given the current issues and complications surrounding chronic wounds, it is believed that developing clinical applications of stem cell therapies is the next rational step in improving wound care.
