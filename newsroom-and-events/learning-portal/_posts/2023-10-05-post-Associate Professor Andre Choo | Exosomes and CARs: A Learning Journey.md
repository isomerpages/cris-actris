In collaboration with Dr Lim Sai Kiang’s lab, A/Prof Choo and his team have developed a manufacturing process for (Mesenchymal Stem Cells) MSC-derived exosomes. Unlike traditional stem cell therapies, exosomes are “cell-free” nanomedicine that provides a safer alternative. Here, the considerations to develop the upstream cell culture and conditioned medium preparation of the manufacturing process will be discussed. Separately, one of the main challenges of CAR-T therapy is the identification of a unique antigen, i.e. only present on tumor cells and not normal cells. Further insights will be elaborated during the session.
