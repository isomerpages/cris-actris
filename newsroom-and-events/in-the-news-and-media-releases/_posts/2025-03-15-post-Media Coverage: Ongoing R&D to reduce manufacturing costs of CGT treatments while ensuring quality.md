<h3>Ongoing R&amp;D to reduce manufacturing costs of cell and gene therapy treatments while ensuring quality</h3>
<hr>
<p>Singapore is using cell and gene therapy to transform its cancer treatments.
Doctors say it offers relapsed blood cancer patients a 50 per cent chance
of full remission. New biopharma programmes with a focus on cell and gene
therapy aim to make these life-saving treatments more affordable, without
compromising quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this exclusive feature by <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/ongoing-rd-reduce-manufacturing-costs-cell-therapy-treatments-while-ensuring-quality-5002931" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Channel News Asia</a>,
Adj A/Prof Yap Eng Soo, Chief Medical Officer, Advanced Cell Therapy and
Research Institute, Singapore (ACTRIS), shared that the pooling of resources
in a national manufacturing facility such as ACTRIS will help achieve economies
of scale and ultimately bring down the cost of such therapies.</p>
<p>The story also highlighted a patient profile, Mr Tang Ping Kee, who shared
how a grim diagnosis of a rare brain cancer was transformed into a ray
of hope through chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy.</p>
<p><em>For reference: In the recent <a href="Ministry%20of%20Trade%20and%20Industry%20Committee%20of%20Supply%20Debate%202025%20on%206%20Mar%202025,%20Minister%20Tan%20See%20Leng%20shared%20that%20cell%20therapies%20such%20as%20CAR-T" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ministry of Trade and Industry Committee of Supply Debate 2025 on 6 Mar 2025</a>, 2M Tan See Leng shared that cell therapies such as CAR-T have transformed treatment for certain blood cancers and demonstrated promise for autoimmune diseases but they remain complex and expensive to manufacture.</em>
