The Regulatory Affair Lifecycle would include data and process analysis, regulatory submission, follow-ups, approvals which eventually lead to clinical evaluation/trials, commercialization and/or marketing. Regulatory submission would involve submission of documents and records from the initial stages of process development, right up to manufacturing of the final product. With ACTRIS managing your project from the initial stages, we would be able to reduce both time and rework in your regulatory affair life cycle thus making the process both time- and cost-effective.
