<h4>Education and Training</h4>
<p>ACTRIS Education and Training is set up to support ACTRIS in one of the
three aspects of its mission, that is, to equip those involved in various
aspects of cellular-based therapyâ€™s value chain with skills and knowledge.
Cell therapy training is critical in stepping up cell, tissue and gene
therapy work in Singapore and region and we are able to leverage on our
internal expertise in process development &amp; validation, product characterization,
clinical trials, clinical care and clinical cell manufacturing for training
and education.</p>
<p>We develop public and customized training courses which cover various
aspects of immunotherapy and regenerative medicine to meet the manpower
needs in cell, tissue and gene therapy. It aims to be a leading and innovative
education and training platform for the cell, tissue and gene therapy community
in Singapore and beyond as well as a community builder of knowledge experts
and passionate learners.</p>
