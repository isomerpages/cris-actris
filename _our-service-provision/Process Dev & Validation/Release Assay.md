Quality and safety check are achieved via release assays and tests. There will be quality oversight to ensure the suitability, reproducibility, accuracy and sensitivity of the associated assays for each procedure, in accordance to the regulatory requirements for the study phases. Investigators are able to select a panel of in-house assays to suit their specific demand but will broadly cover assays that establishes dosage, identity, purity, potency, sterility and residual ancillary materials. Alternatively, ACTRIS would facilitate the investigators in developing unique assays as required for their protocols.
