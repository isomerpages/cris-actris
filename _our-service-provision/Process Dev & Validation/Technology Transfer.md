The completion of clinical trial phases leads to commercial manufacturing as accompanied by the demands of an offsite technology transfer. ACTRIS is able to partner with the clients on this commercialization journey by assembling a translational package that ports the required processes to the new site while minimizing delays. This is achieved by an acute understanding of the technical nuances and regulatory concerns. The technology transfer services are also available for incoming manufacturing processes into ACTRIS from other centers.
