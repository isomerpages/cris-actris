<p>Reagents and consumables, commonly referred to as ancillary material,
are indispensable in realizing a quality manufacturing of cell, tissue,
and gene therapy products.
<br>
<br>Attention is given to the selection of these components so to as shorten
the process development / validation phase by choosing materials that comply
with regulatory standards while enabling maintenance of product quality
and potency.
<br>
<br>An in-house ancillary material master file aids this effort as it represents
specific know how on suitability, feasibility, quality, compliance, and
safety. This cell-specific list of ancillary material will be derived via
in-house experimentation and/or literature search and will be made available
to ACTRIS clients.</p>
